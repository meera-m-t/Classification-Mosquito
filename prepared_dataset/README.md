## Prepared the dataset: 
We apply Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)  then we apply Graphcut. After that, we apply connected components in OpenCV to remove the small unwanted component. Eventually, we crop the object.

### Our goal of preparing the dataset is to extract the object of the image and put it in the specified coordinate on the black background.
